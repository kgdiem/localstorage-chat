# LocalStorage Chat

## What is it?

LocalStorage chat was an app I made as a screening for a job interview.

### Features

1. Stores messages in LocalStorage
2. Paginates messages
3. User can refresh or send another message to see new messages from other users(tabs)

## Layout & Reasonings

There is a top level \_\_mocks\_\_ folder as these can be shared throughtout the app.

There is a \_\_tests\_\_ directory in each folder where there are tests.

Each component has its own folder/module to keep the folder clean and readable.

The hooks folder has a custom hook that allows for reading the query string.

The lib directory has services and helper functions. I made the services objects rather than clsses because I wanted every method to be static rather than creating a class every time they're used. I also didn't feel the need to track any state. I made the service methods return promises to simulate an API call.

For the store I used the standard redux pattern. Easy enough.

## Testing

I wrote tests for all of the logic in the services and store. For the sake of time I didn't include component tests aside from making sure `<App/>` renders without error.

I changed the `package.json` to run `react-scripts test --verbose` because I prefer to see the names of the tests.

Make sure to hit `a` in the terminal window if only the `<App/>` test runs & you'd like to see them all.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
